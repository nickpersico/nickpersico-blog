They are in the middle of a three game set with the scrappy Oakland A’s at home, who currently sit 2 games ahead of the Orioles in the Wild Card standings.\n\nBoth teams are similar, carrying a low payroll in relation to the big market teams and have young rising stars who have yet to see their first big long-term contract.\n\nOverall, it’s a great match up that any baseball fan would love.\n\nBut I can’t watch the game.\n\nI just moved to NYC, which puts me out of the Orioles’ market.\n\n### MLB.TV\n\nSince I don’t live in the Baltimore-Washington area, I subscribe to MLB.TV Premium. MLB.TV allows to me to watch any Orioles game on any device when they are not playing in the local market I am located in due to blackout restrictions.\n\nI pay a hefty $19.99/month, but I’m a fan without a cable or satellite subscription so that’s the only option I have.\n\nWhen I saw that the Orioles-Athletics first pitch is set for 4:05PM, I logged onto MLB.TV and saw this:\n\n![Alt](http://media.tumblr.com/cc420ff2584e4263296469c2485ff981/tumblr_inline_ms1i46ogHB1qz4rgp.png)\n\nThe Orioles-Athletics game is being televised “nationally” by FOX, therefore it’s blacked out on MLB.TV.\n\nOkay, it’s being televised “nationally”, so I will just turn on my TV, go to a friend’s house, or a bar to watch the game. No big deal.\n\nNot so fast. There are two other games being televised “nationally” at the same time. How will this work?\n\n### The FOX TV Coverage Map\n\nI’m currently in New York, so let’s try to find a coverage map of where each game is being televised “nationally” this afternoon:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/0f33fb7d6f4c3f777adb3bbe18ebab99/tumblr_inline_ms1i5c0IfC1qz4rgp.png)\n\nUh oh, the Mets are also being televised by the MLB on FOX. Therefore, NYC and the greater part of their market is going to be shown their game. Oakland @ Baltimore is only going to be shown in the markets highlighted in green.\n\nI can’t watch the game.\n\nThe MLB offers a service that I pay over $100 per season to compensate for the fact that I don’t live in my favorite team’s market. But on Saturday, FOX and the MLB have an agreement that any game they televise “nationally” will be blacked out on their service.\n\nHowever, the games are not televised nationally. They are televised regionally. So if I’m not in the market where they decide to televise the game, I’m shit out of luck.\n\nWhy am I fan? Why do I even pay for the MLB’s overpriced service? For the love of the game I guess.\n\nBut I can’t watch the game, unless I break the law.\n\n### Watching Illegally\n\nThe only way I can watch the Orioles game today is via the plethora of websites that are carrying illegal live streams of the game.\n\nThese are individuals and groups, mostly European, who are broadcasting live streams of their MLB.TV account to other fans who can’t watch the game either. They are not in the United States, to domestic blackout restrictions don’t apply.\n\nThis means that I’m forced to break the law and watch a live stream through another live stream, leaving the quality pixelated and choppy. But I’ll deal with it to watch my team.\n\n### Forcing A Fan To Break The Law\n\nThe MLB and FOX have put me in a position where the only way I can be a fan and watch my team is illegal.\n\nI pay for a service that I can’t use in MLB.TV because my team is contending, and their games get picked up by the awful MLB on FOX Saturday broadcasts.\n\nHow is this right? How is this fair?\n\nIt is because the fans have no power. The fans have no say. The game is to good too boycott or leave. We are slaves to the game, and the MLB and FOX are making millions of dollars from our captivity.\n\nI am a fan that is willing to pay to watch my team play, but these corporations have set up a system that makes it impossible for me to do so.\n\nMaybe my elected government representatives can do something?

To put this belief into action, we wanted to take high-level sales activities such as calls made, pipeline created, revenue made, & week-over-week growth and display it for the entire office to see.\n\nWith new sales data being generated every minute, we needed a way to display this information to the whole team without having to update anything manually. The dashboards had to look pretty too. After tinkering with a few dashboards-as-a-service platforms, we picked [Leftronic](http://www.leftronic.com) because their push API is simple to use and already having a Python package didn’t hurt either.\n\nThen we just needed to push data to Leftronic.\n\nWe use [Close.io](http://www.close.io) as our CRM. Our sales culture and process depends heavily on calling prospects and customers, and Close.io fully integrates VoiP phone calls. It’s a great fit for us, especially because all of your data is easily accessible via their [API](http://developer.close.io). I highly recommend Close.io for any B2B startup that wants to get serious about sales outreach (more on this later).\n\nHere’s how we made our awesome live sales dashboards using Leftronic, Close.io, and a simple python script.\n\n### The Krossover Sales Dashboard\n\nHere’s a peek at one of the sales dashboards we have up in our office:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/88be4a409f118767df94f6364194b945/tumblr_inline_mnhdtqNxSY1qz4rgp.png)\n\n#### From Close.io To Leftronic\n\nThe neat thing about Close.io is that you can get almost any reporting or search query page to generate a JSON response.\n\nAs an example, here’s how easy it is get the amount of calls your whole team made today and post it to a Leftronic widget on a dashboard:\n\n<code class=\"prettyprint lang-python\">\n<pre>\nimport requests, json\nfrom leftronic import Leftronic\nimport datetime\n\n#Your Close.io & Leftronic API Credentials\ncloseio_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nupdate = Leftronic(\"YOUR_LEFTRONIC_ACCESS_KEY\")\n\n#Use the datetime library to retrieve the current day's report\ntoday = datetime.date.today()\ntomorrow = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)\n\n#Today's activity report URL, using strings to always display the current day's report\ntoday_report = 'https://app.close.io/api/v1/report/{YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID}?user_id=all&date_start=%sT04:00:00.000Z&date_end=%sT06:59:59.999Z' % (today, tomorrow)\n\n#JSON response from Close.io\nresponse = requests.get(today_report, auth=(closeio_key, ''), headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})\n\n#Retrieves the JSON response, and getting just the calls made\ncalls_today = response.json['calls']\n\n#Pushes the number of calls to your Leftronic widget\nupdate.pushNumber(\"LEFTRONIC_WIDGET_STREAM_NAME\", calls_today)\n</pre>\n</code>\n\nTo get the above code to work, you’ll need to reference the following:\n\n* The [Requests](http://python-requests.org) python library\n* The [Leftronic Python package](https://github.com/leftronic/leftronic-python)\n* [Close.io API Docs](http://developer.close.io)\n* [Leftronic Python API Docs](https://www.leftronic.com/api/#python)\n* A \"pushNumber\" widget on a Leftronic dashboard\n\n### Close.io Reporting URLs\n\nClose.io’s API documentation does a great job of describing how to format certain URLs to get the type of data you would like. Not only can you get a response on your activity or pipeline reports, but you can also retrieve a list of leads using search:\n\n<i>Sample URL For All New Active Opportunities In Last 7 Days:</i>\n\n<code class=\"prettyprint lang-python\">\n<pre>\n#Always use URL encode formatting for any query\nurl = 'https://app.close.io/api/v1/lead/?query=opportunity_created%20%3C%20%227%20days%20ago%22%20opportunity_status%3Aactive'\n</pre>\n</code>\n\n<i>Sample URL For An Individual User’s 7-Day Activity Report:</i>\n\n<code class=\"prettyprint lang-python\">\n<pre>\n#See Close.io docs to get ORG_ID & USER_ID\nurl = 'https://app.close.io/api/v1/report/{YOUR_ORG_ID}/?type=activity&user_id={YOUR_SALES_USERS_ID}&date_start=%sT04:00:00.000Z&date_end=%sT06:59:59.999Z' % (sevendays, tomorrow)'\n</pre>\n</code>\n\nPushing Close.io Data To Leftronic\n\nLeftronic provides some great documentation on how to push your data to the appropriate widgets, but here is an example that includes some nuances with Close.io:\n\n<i>Pushing Won Revenue To A Sparkline</i>\n\n<code>\n<pre>\nupdate.pushNumber(\"yourSparklineName\", {\"prefix\": \"$\", \"number\": \"%0.2f\" % wonrevenue/100.0})\n</pre>\n</code>\n\nClose.io outputs all currency in cents, so you’ll need to divide by 100.0 and put the decimal point in the right place.\n\nThe most rewarding widgets for us are line graphs and sparklines. Since our data is being pushed every couple of minutes, Leftronic logs each time it receives new data and gives you a couple of options for which duration of time you’d like to display.\n\nSo if you are tracking week-over-week growth (if not, you should start), you can visualize the data over time by sending continuous updates to Leftronic and let the data pile up over time.\n\n### Updating The Dashboard Automatically\n\nI welcome any better solutions, but I update all of my sales dashboards using a Mac app called Lingon 3. It allows me to automatically run the dashboard script every couple of minutes off my laptop in the form of a cron task:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/968bd4d1d767a18f3b85c1cd2b7a1ecc/tumblr_inline_mnhc1iOUYf1qz4rgp.png)\n\n### Questions?

I purchase my favorite team’s swag, attend several games per season, read countless blogs, and pay for premium services like MLB.TV.\n\nCome to think of it, a good portion of my income and time is spent on MLB related activities.\n\nEach time I go to spend money on various MLB-related items, I start realize how broken their model is. It’s fascinating how much money the MLB and other professional leagues, sports networks, cable providers and their respective franchises are leaving on the table to maintain the status quo.\n\nThrough my own experiences as a fan, below are examples of why the MLB and its media partners are taking advantage of fans. These examples are only directly applied to MLB.TV and Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) who have the television rights to the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals.\n\n#### MLB.TV Blackout Restrictions - The Remote Fan\n\nI currently live in San Francisco, but I’m a huge Baltimore sports fan. I’m 24 years old and understand the Internet, so any content I want to watch is readily available online. I don’t want or need a cable subscription. I'm a cable cutter.\n\nBut I still pay a lot for my entertainment. Hence my current media subscriptions:\n\n* Netflix - $7.99/mo\n* Rdio - $9.99/mo\n* MLB.TV Premium - $24.99/mo during season\n* Xbox Live - $9.99/mo\n\nI also watch my fair share of WatchESPN, but I use my parent’s cable subscription credentials to watch “locked” events. The same is true with HBO GO. I should use this time to make ESPN and HBO aware that everyone of my friends is also doing this. I’m sure you know it. You must know it.\n\nMy Baltimore Orioles have spent this weekend in Oakland playing a 4-game series against the A’s. I consider myself a dedicated fan, so I gladly went to the Friday night game to cheer them on.\n\nFor the other three games, I’ll have to watch them at home while I take care of some work, do my laundry, and click refresh on my Twitter feed. You know, things a responsible twenty-something does.\n\nSo I fire up my MLB.TV around game time, and I’m faced with this message:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/eebf418a01e882da5f925d578dc8f9aa/tumblr_inline_mlzgouQT3m1qz4rgp.png)\n\nOh no, the dreaded Blackout Restriction message. Since I’m attempting to watch the Orioles-A’s game in the A’s TV market, the game is not available through MLB.TV. So now I’m forced to watch the game on cable with the subscription I don’t have. Even worse, I have to watch the opposing team’s broadcast.\n\nFan Tip: Don’t worry, there’s plenty of free “unofficial” places to watch the game. Ironically, the stream’s source is someone streaming their MLB.TV account.\n\nSince the local sports networks, MLB, and cable providers can’t seem to agree on terms that could result in more revenue for them, the fans are left to suffer.\n\nLooking at the Orioles schedule for 2013, it appears that almost 10% of their games will fall under the MLB’s Blackout Restrictions. This also includes those dreadful Saturday afternoon FOX national broadcasts. I assume that larger market teams would have more games fall under the blackout restrictions, because they have more nationally televised games.\n\nAs a fan and paying customer of MLB.TV, I receive 10% less of the service I pay full price for. You can even argue that full price is overpriced, but that’s a separate argument.\n\n#### MLB.TV Blackout Restrictions - The Local/Regional Fan\n\nFor a local/regional Baltimore/Washington fan, MLB.TV is virtually useless. This is the most ironic and puzzling part of the service offering. Why go through all the trouble and cost of creating a service that the overwhelming majority of it’s target market can’t use?\n\nIf you’re an Orioles or Nationals fan living in the below areas, all games will be blacked out on MLB.TV:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/d29690830b986332a5b087cbf1f1c516/tumblr_inline_mlzivmCvgx1qz4rgp.jpg)\n\nI lived in Charlotte, North Carolina for a year, I had to deal with this nonsense.\n\n#### Granting Access = More Revenue\n\nThe above restrictions would make sense if MLB, MASN, or Time Warner could prove that they lose revenue by allowing consumers access.\n\nFrom my point of view, they lose revenue by not allowing access.\n\nIt’s a known fact that the number of cable subscribers is declining rapidly. Consumers like me are finding less of a need to purchase overpriced cable subscriptions.\n\nI want to buy subscriptions to direct content that I want. I don’t need to pay for 700+ channels if I only watch a handful.\n\nUnlike our leaders in government, when I bitch about something I like to provide possible solutions that could result in an agreement for everyone involved. Here’s a set of solutions for each party involved:\n\n#### Dear Major League Baseball, Franchises:\n\nYou’re are doing so many positive things in the digital/tech space to enhance the fan experience. The team at MLB Advanced Media does a great job with social media, online fan engagement, and more. In my opinion, they are the best professional sports league when it comes to digital media.\n\nBut why aren’t you pushing the sports networks and cable providers to follow you? You’ve created additional opportunities for revenue streams for all of you but have not capitalized on them.\n\nWhen I’m watching a MASN telecast of an Orioles game on MLB.TV, this is the message I see when there is a break in the action:\n\n![alt](http://media.tumblr.com/9d1824ba37f9229e979ab9ce97401819/tumblr_inline_mlzk1gOzFC1qz4rgp.png)\n\nThis is absolutely hilarious. Why aren’t you, your advertisers, the sports network, or cable provider trying to sell me shit?\n\nUpdate: There are advertisements during game breaks, but I only counted two over the course of a 3-hour game. Two of the same ads over and over. They were national ads from Microsoft and Old Spice, not targeted at all.\n\nYou have so much more data on me than a cable provider does. You could know what device I’m watching the game on, where I’m watching the game, what teams I like to watch, or how long I watch in a session. Use those demographics to sell me shit. Tell advertisers that you can give them a much larger ROI because of the information you have.\n\nThrough this added revenue stream, you could decrease the cost of your service. That could mean more subscribers, or more inventory to sell to advertisers.\n\n#### Dear Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN):\n\nI like your telecasts, I really do. But you do such a great job of not allowing fans to view your content.\n\nYou refuse to allow local/regional Orioles and Nationals fans to watch your telecasts on the devices they use all day. I guess you’re just content with taking a percentage of cable subscribers’ bill every month.\n\nYou’ve been fighting with Time Warner in North Carolina for years. Why are you fighting over the opportunity to reach more fans? Do more fans mean more advertisement revenue? Do you want more subscribers that unknowingly pay a percentage of their cable bill to you - even if they never turn on your channel?\n\nYou televise two teams that are a part of Major League Baseball, and the MLB has paid millions of dollars to allow fans to watch your games on the go. They paid for the technology, but you don’t seem to be interested in providing the content to the majority of your target market.\n\nWouldn’t it be cool to tell your advertisers that they could reach fans that watch the game on their laptops, smartphones and tablets?\n\nPlease explain to me how you lose revenue by providing access to your telecasts through these new platforms. I don’t see how it’s possible.\n\n#### Dear Cable Providers:\n\nYou are the reason why all of this continues to happen. If an entrepreneur’s business model is deteriorating, they innovate and create new revenue streams to remain successful.\n\nInstead, you cowards elect to use your influence to slow down progress and innovation. You’re the ones who deserve to lose. You don’t create your own content, nor do you provide any real value anymore. So why do we need you?\n\nWe don’t.\n\nIn this day and age, companies that provide access to content must also produce content to survive. Netflix is a perfect example of this.\n\nSo I don’t have a solution for you. All things must come to an end. It’s your turn. Please go die with dignity.\n\n#### And finally, the fans:\n\nAs fans, we need to stand up for ourselves. We're the fuel that runs the entire machine. We’re spending tons of money to support these clowns, yet we don’t ever make them earn it. We need to be more vocal about these inconveniences and demand change. This is my version of that.\n\nIt may not do anything, but this long venting session in the form of a blog post has made me feel better.","html":"<p>I’m the ideal MLB fan and consumer.

You know, things a responsible twenty-something does.</p>\n\n<p>So I fire up my MLB.TV around game time, and I’m faced with this message:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/eebf418a01e882da5f925d578dc8f9aa/tumblr_inline_mlzgouQT3m1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>Oh no, the dreaded Blackout Restriction message. Since I’m attempting to watch the Orioles-A’s game in the A’s TV market, the game is not available through MLB.TV. So now I’m forced to watch the game on cable with the subscription I don’t have. Even worse, I have to watch the opposing team’s broadcast.</p>\n\n<p>Fan Tip: Don’t worry, there’s plenty of free “unofficial” places to watch the game. Ironically, the stream’s source is someone streaming their MLB.TV account.</p>\n\n<p>Since the local sports networks, MLB, and cable providers can’t seem to agree on terms that could result in more revenue for them, the fans are left to suffer.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the Orioles schedule for 2013, it appears that almost 10% of their games will fall under the MLB’s Blackout Restrictions. This also includes those dreadful Saturday afternoon FOX national broadcasts. I assume that larger market teams would have more games fall under the blackout restrictions, because they have more nationally televised games.</p>\n\n<p>As a fan and paying customer of MLB.TV, I receive 10% less of the service I pay full price for. You can even argue that full price is overpriced, but that’s a separate argument.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"mlbtvblackoutrestrictionsthelocalregionalfan\">MLB.TV Blackout Restrictions - The Local/Regional Fan</h4>\n\n<p>For a local/regional Baltimore/Washington fan, MLB.TV is virtually useless. This is the most ironic and puzzling part of the service offering. Why go through all the trouble and cost of creating a service that the overwhelming majority of it’s target market can’t use?</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an Orioles or Nationals fan living in the below areas, all games will be blacked out on MLB.TV:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/d29690830b986332a5b087cbf1f1c516/tumblr_inline_mlzivmCvgx1qz4rgp.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>I lived in Charlotte, North Carolina for a year, I had to deal with this nonsense.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"grantingaccessmorerevenue\">Granting Access = More Revenue</h4>\n\n<p>The above restrictions would make sense if MLB, MASN, or Time Warner could prove that they lose revenue by allowing consumers access.</p>\n\n<p>From my point of view, they lose revenue by not allowing access.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a known fact that the number of cable subscribers is declining rapidly. Consumers like me are finding less of a need to purchase overpriced cable subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>I want to buy subscriptions to direct content that I want. I don’t need to pay for 700+ channels if I only watch a handful.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike our leaders in government, when I bitch about something I like to provide possible solutions that could result in an agreement for everyone involved. Here’s a set of solutions for each party involved:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"dearmajorleaguebaseballfranchises\">Dear Major League Baseball, Franchises:</h4>\n\n<p>You’re are doing so many positive things in the digital/tech space to enhance the fan experience. The team at MLB Advanced Media does a great job with social media, online fan engagement, and more. In my opinion, they are the best professional sports league when it comes to digital media.</p>\n\n<p>But why aren’t you pushing the sports networks and cable providers to follow you? You’ve created additional opportunities for revenue streams for all of you but have not capitalized on them.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m watching a MASN telecast of an Orioles game on MLB.TV, this is the message I see when there is a break in the action:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/9d1824ba37f9229e979ab9ce97401819/tumblr_inline_mlzk1gOzFC1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is absolutely hilarious. Why aren’t you, your advertisers, the sports network, or cable provider trying to sell me shit?</p>\n\n<p>Update: There are advertisements during game breaks, but I only counted two over the course of a 3-hour game. Two of the same ads over and over. They were national ads from Microsoft and Old Spice, not targeted at all.</p>\n\n<p>You have so much more data on me than a cable provider does. You could know what device I’m watching the game on, where I’m watching the game, what teams I like to watch, or how long I watch in a session. Use those demographics to sell me shit. Tell advertisers that you can give them a much larger ROI because of the information you have.</p>\n\n<p>Through this added revenue stream, you could decrease the cost of your service. That could mean more subscribers, or more inventory to sell to advertisers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"dearmidatlanticsportsnetworkmasn\">Dear Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN):</h4>\n\n<p>I like your telecasts, I really do. But you do such a great job of not allowing fans to view your content.</p>\n\n<p>You refuse to allow local/regional Orioles and Nationals fans to watch your telecasts on the devices they use all day. I guess you’re just content with taking a percentage of cable subscribers’ bill every month.</p>\n\n<p>You’ve been fighting with Time Warner in North Carolina for years. Why are you fighting over the opportunity to reach more fans? Do more fans mean more advertisement revenue? Do you want more subscribers that unknowingly pay a percentage of their cable bill to you - even if they never turn on your channel?</p>\n\n<p>You televise two teams that are a part of Major League Baseball, and the MLB has paid millions of dollars to allow fans to watch your games on the go. They paid for the technology, but you don’t seem to be interested in providing the content to the majority of your target market.</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to tell your advertisers that they could reach fans that watch the game on their laptops, smartphones and tablets?</p>\n\n<p>Please explain to me how you lose revenue by providing access to your telecasts through these new platforms. I don’t see how it’s possible.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"dearcableproviders\">Dear Cable Providers:</h4>\n\n<p>You are the reason why all of this continues to happen. If an entrepreneur’s business model is deteriorating, they innovate and create new revenue streams to remain successful.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you cowards elect to use your influence to slow down progress and innovation. You’re the ones who deserve to lose. You don’t create your own content, nor do you provide any real value anymore. So why do we need you?</p>\n\n<p>We don’t.</p>\n\n<p>In this day and age, companies that provide access to content must also produce content to survive. Netflix is a perfect example of this.</p>\n\n<p>So I don’t have a solution for you. All things must come to an end. It’s your turn. Please go die with dignity.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"andfinallythefans\">And finally, the fans:</h4>\n\n<p>As fans, we need to stand up for ourselves. We're the fuel that runs the entire machine. We’re spending tons of money to support these clowns, yet we don’t ever make them earn it. We need to be more vocal about these inconveniences and demand change. This is my version of that.</p>\n\n<p>It may not do anything, but this long venting session in the form of a blog post has made me feel better.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1385343750849,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1398226482520,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1367164800000,"published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"cfa8923d-4fbf-4edc-926c-9ee00b7689cd","title":"Angelist's Naval Ravikant On Outsourcing","slug":"angelists-naval-ravikant-on-outsourcing","markdown":"During last night’s PandoMonthly event, Angelist’s co-founder Naval Ravikant made very interesting comments about how the structure of companies may look in the future.

The goal of this post is to start a conversation, that will hopefully include experts in the online ticketing industry. Ticket prices and fees vary by ticket distribution platform, artist, venue, and promoter. I realize that Ticketmaster may/may not be the only one to blame for this horrible transaction process.</i>\n\n#### 23.8% Of My Ticket Price Were Charges & Fees\n\nI recently purchased two tickets to a concert at a venue in San Francisco. The concert is in late October, and I am guessing that it will be sold out. I went to the artist’s website, found the tour date in San Francisco, and clicked “Buy Tickets”. Then I was taken to Ticketmaster to purchase the tickets.\n\n#### The “Convenience Charge”\n\nAs I moved through the buying process, the fee frenzy began with the infamous “Convenience Charge”:\n\n![alt](http://www.wearluckystripes.com/media/tm-01.png)\n\nA whopping $10.30 per ticket convenience charge. That is 25.7% of the total ticket price. I really want to go to the concert, so I decided to proceed to the next step.\n\n#### The “Delivery Charge”\n\nThe next step of the Ticketmaster process is the “Select Delivery Method” page, where you choose how you will receive your tickets. It’s 2012, I have a printer, smartphone, and common sense. Printing my tickets is a no brainer.\n\nBefore I select Ticketmasters “TicketFast” print at home delivery method, I see a charge of $2.50 per order! What the hell?!\n\n![alt](http://www.wearluckystripes.com/media/tm-02.png)\n\nLet me get this straight, I need to pay $2.50 to print out my tickets at home; but it’s free for Ticketmaster to print/sort/mail the tickets to me? Isn’t technology supposed to help save everyone money?\n\nI do or don’t do a lot of things based on the principle. So I made the choice to have the tickets mailed to me. Hooray, I saved $2.50 by electing to not use a piece of technology that every other ticket outlet on the planet has been offering for years.\n\n#### The “Order Processing Fee”\n\nI’ve come this far, so I might as well continue with my purchase. Like I said, I really want to attend this concert. It’s now the final step of my purchase, so I begin to double check my order information…\n\nBefore I click Purchase and throw a fist pump in the air, I notice another fee. An “Order Processing Fee” for $4.45. You guys can’t be serious.\n\n![alt](http://www.wearluckystripes.com/media/tm-03.png)\n\nCharges and fees have now accounted for 23.8% of my total purchase price. If I had chosen the “TicketFast” print-at-home feature, the charges and fees would been 25.6% of my total purchase price. Wowzers.\n\n#### A Broken Pricing Structure\n\nIt’s not about the total price, it’s how we arrived at the total price. Do I think it’s worth paying $52.52 per ticket to go this concert? Absolutely. Shit guys, I would pay $60.\n\nThe first price I saw per ticket was $40. The price I paid was $52.52, after taking me through several steps to actually complete the purchase. You gave me multiple opportunities to change my mind about purchasing altogether.\n\nAs a consumer, I should only have to say I want to buy once. Hey artist and/or venue, you worked so hard to get me to your website and click the “Buy Tickets” button. Why do you allow your ticketing service to throw that all away with a poorly designed checkout process?\n\n#### It’s Time To Change, Here’s What Needs To Happen:\n\nSomeone Needs To Create A New Ticketing Platform - Create a online/mobile ticketing platform for venues and artists that does not charge per transaction. Your revenues are generated by a monthly subscription to the artist or venue. Hey Eventbrite, are you listening? There are 18,000+ (Source) of eligible live music venues in the US, so there is a big enough target market there for you to succeed. Please let me know if this platform already exists.\n\nVenues/Artists Need To Ditch The Big Guys - Take control of your event ticketing system by using the above subscription platform that charges you per month, not per ticket. Please let me know if this already exists.\n\nAll-Inclusive Pricing Model - Now you can sell tickets for an all-inclusive price. The first ticket price that the fans will see. So my ticket cost should remain $52.52 (see above), but it will go directly to the parties that actually do the hard work.\n\nOffer More Music/Merchandise + Ticket Packages - I love this idea and have already seen some bands offering this (Circa Survive). This one’s for the content creators. As a fan, I would love to buy your new album, some merch, and a ticket to the upcoming concert in my city at a subsidized cost per item. Great way to sell some advance tickets.\n\n<i>Forget Everything I Just Wrote, We Should All Learn From Louis C.K. - https://buy.louisck.net/tour-dates</i>","html":"<p><i>Disclaimer: I am not an expert in the online ticketing industry.

We want to be lean. <i>We want to \"log in\" into as little places as possible.</i> We also want to be able to access any information from anywhere. You know, the cloud!\n\nThe cloud is great, but it's created a massive amount of fragmented sales data across different platforms.\n\nEven worse, that data isn't connected in one place for everyone to see. I often see small to medium size sales teams fall into a situation where sales reps have created their own process. Each rep's phone activity, emails, notes, and pipeline are spread out across the apps they personally like to use for each task.\n\nThen it's up to the sales rep to compile and enter that data into the company's CRM after the fact. Yikes.\n\nAt Krossover, we've done everything we can to make things extremely simple to the user (our sales reps). They make calls, send emails, take notes, and manage their pipeline in one app. There is no data entry.\n\nBelow is a description of every tool and process we use. While it may seem like a lot of \"vendors\", the sales team only actually needs to use four apps to sell Krossover:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The CRM</li>\n    <li>Accounting software</li>\n    <li>A screensharing app to conduct demos</li>\n    <li>KrossoverSales (Our internal reporting app)</li>\n</ol>\n\nThat's it. The rest of it is done behind the scenes to make their selling lives as easy as possible. If you have any questions about any particular tool/service and integrations, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:nick@krossover.com).\n\n### CRM, Phone, Support\n\n####[Close.io](http://www.close.io) (CRM)\n\nOur sales process heavily depends on phone-based outreach to prospects and customers for support. We have 20+ members of our team using Close.io every day for virtually every customer-facing task:\n\n* Prospecting/outbound sales calls + emails\n* Responding to support phone calls\n* Acts as our company telephone system\n* Contains our contact records for all customers\n\nWhile you can classify Close.io as a \"CRM\", it should also be referred to as a productivity tool. Close.io has calling, email, tasks, and pipeline management deeply integrated within the platform. Our team even receives lead lists through Close.io's \"Smart View\" feature.\n\n95% of a sales rep's daily tasks are done within Close.io. You can contact a prospect via phone or email, update information about that deal, and set up action items for next steps all within one window. You don't have to log calls, BCC Close.io on emails, or add leads manually.\n\nAnother very important part of our success with using Close.io is their [API](http://developer.close.io). The API allows us to manipulate any part of the CRM however we'd like. Regardless if we are pushing or pulling data, we are always in control. Think about it, every single aspect of our sales team's data is available via an API call - meaning that we can take that data anywhere and apply it where we need to.\n\n<b>Pros</b>\n\n* Seamless call + email integration\n* Native Mac/Windows apps\n* Flexible/powerful API\n* Great support & API docs\n* Promotes productivity (ex: easy to do 125+ calls/day)\n\n<b>Cons</b>\n\n* Does not have strong reporting out of the box\n* Pricey, make sure you use every aspect of it\n* Does not have duplicate detection (be careful while importing leads!)\n\n####[Desk](http://www.desk.com) (Support/Help Desk)\n\nWe like Desk because of how simple it is to manage your \"help center\", or where customers will learn how to use your product. It's especially important for us, because our customers are not traditionally \"tech savvy\". Therefore, we have a high volume of tickets and need a system that allows us quickly answer our customer's questions.\n\nTo me, Zendesk or any other support platform works just as well. We prefer Desk because it's less expensive for us than Zendesk, and we find it easier to manipulate our support article content.\n\n<b>Tip:</b> Most support platforms have the function of connecting your \"help@\" or \"support@\" to manage tickets. Connect this email address to your CRM. With Close.io, all of the support@ emails between our customers are automatically tracked and appended to their lead. So if anyone wants to take a look at that customer in the CRM, they will see every time the customer was contacted or reached out to our support team.\n\n####[Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper.com) (Phone)\n\nOur implementation of Grasshopper is interesting. While Close.io's phone features handle inbound/outbound calls - it does little for our call routing or IVR needs.\n\nWe wanted to have a cloud-based system that allowed callers to hear a professional voice thanking them for calling us, and giving them options to route them where they want to go. Want sales? Press 1. Want support? Press 2. Need someone in particular? Enter their extension.\n\nAt the same time, all of the inbound calls need to funnel through Close.io just as our outbound calls do. Grasshopper and Close.io work beautifully together.\n\nHere is a diagram of how our phone routing works:\n![alt](http://s10.postimg.org/9dd43zpd5/krossover_ivr_diagram.png)\n\nAt the end of routing, all calls are ultimately sent to Close.io where they are tracked and appended to the appropriate leads like every other call.\n\n### Part 2 - Inbound Sales\n\nIn part two, I will cover what tools and processes we use to handle inbound sales. How do we get leads from our website into our CRM? How do we get email marketing data into our CRM? How do we assign inbound leads fairly?\n\nStay tuned for part two, and let me know if there is anything in particular you'd like covered!\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>As the sales operations manager at Krossover, it's my job to make sure the sales team have all of the tools they need to be successful.</p>\n\n<p>We want to be super productive. We want to be lean. <i>We want to \"log in\" into as little places as possible.</i> We also want to be able to access any information from anywhere. You know, the cloud!</p>\n\n<p>The cloud is great, but it's created a massive amount of fragmented sales data across different platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Even worse, that data isn't connected in one place for everyone to see. I often see small to medium size sales teams fall into a situation where sales reps have created their own process. Each rep's phone activity, emails, notes, and pipeline are spread out across the apps they personally like to use for each task.</p>\n\n<p>Then it's up to the sales rep to compile and enter that data into the company's CRM after the fact. Yikes.</p>\n\n<p>At Krossover, we've done everything we can to make things extremely simple to the user (our sales reps). They make calls, send emails, take notes, and manage their pipeline in one app. There is no data entry.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a description of every tool and process we use. While it may seem like a lot of \"vendors\", the sales team only actually needs to use four apps to sell Krossover:</p>\n\n<ol>  \n    <li>The CRM</li>\n    <li>Accounting software</li>\n    <li>A screensharing app to conduct demos</li>\n    <li>KrossoverSales (Our internal reporting app)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's it.

Make sure you <a href=\"http://nickpersico.com/tools-of-the-trade-part-1/\">check out Part 1.</a></i>\n\nIn part two of my \"Tools of the Trade\" series, we'll cover every aspect of how we manage our inbound sales process.\n\n#### Inbound Lead Sources\n\nAt Krossover, inbound leads come to us from a wide variety of places. I like to think that our market is unique because we don't have a large amount of prospects actively searching for the product and services we provide. The audience is just not there. This means that common search engine marketing strategies have a low return and don't really work.\n\nThis forces us to constantly generate inbound sales ourselves. We have direct and indirect content to get prospects to come to us. I can't recall one of our sales reps ever hearing a coach say \"I was Googling about game film breakdown and found you guys\". It just doesn't happen.\n\nIt may seem like an oxymoron, but we create outbound marketing to generate inbound.\n\nHere are the most common inbound lead sources we have:\n\n* Website Sign Ups\n* Twitter (a mix of organic + sponsored + followers)\n* LinkedIn (organic + sponsored)\n* Coaches Clinics & Events\n* Referrals\n\n#### Avoid Manual Lead Creation At All Costs\n\nWe are in a relatively \"fixed\" market. Our prospects are mostly high schools and colleges, which makes lead sourcing pretty easy. For us, \"verticals\" are sports, not types of a businesses. With our present product and service offering, we know the maximum amount of customers we could conceivably have.\n\nBecause of this, we actually don't wait for the leads to come to us. We create all of the leads and place whatever sourced data we can find for every potential customer beforehand. Then we match the new leads coming in against the \"database\" of leads we created.\n\nWhy is this important? Clean and streamlined data.\n\nI absolutely hate it when sales reps or anyone manually enters leads. Not only is it a huge time waster, but it's really difficult to get everyone using the same formatting.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Jerry creates a lead called Central High School\n* Billy creates a lead called Central HS\n* Sally creates a lead called Central High School - California\n\n\nNo. You must control how all data is entered. Sales reps don't mind because the only true data entry they are doing is activity based.\n\nAs leads come in, sales reps are trained to search the database and merge/append the new information to the lead that already exists. This promotes clean and complete data, and saves everyone time. It also forces the sales rep to look and see if there is any previous history on the supposed new lead he/she is about to reach out to.\n\nThe rule is that if you are selling to a relatively pre-defined market, try to source and import all of the prospects first. Then let inbound and sales rep activity data be appended to the lead that already exists.\n\nFor example: If you want to pitch all of the companies in the \"Fortune 500\", gather and source all 500 companies in your CRM prior to outreach begins. Then start to append all of the activity. Or else, Microsoft will be in your CRM several times.\n\n#### Website → Zapier → CRM\n\nA service that we use heavily is <a href=\"http://www.zapier.com\">Zapier</a>.\n\nZapier allows us \"zap\" data to-and-from various services that we use. Need to send Wufoo entries to the CRM? Zap it. Need to send certain types of customer emails to Desk for the support team to handle? Zap it.\n\nHere are the top five \"zaps\" we use with Zapier:\n\n1. Send new Wufoo form entries to Close.io.\n2. Send new chat messages into HipChat from Close.io and Desk.\n\t* Ex: <i>\"Billy just closed Central High School for $1000. Good job!\"</i>\n3. Send new website signup leads to Close.io.\n4. Send tweets about Krossover into HipChat.\n5. Create new support tickets in Desk from tweets and other services.\n\nFor anyone that is looking to streamline data from a wide variety of services using a simple UI rather than working with an API, I highly recommend Zapier.\n\nOur marketing team creates their own zaps without a single line of code!\n\n#### Lead Assignment\n\nAs we have grown our sales team, we've also had to mitigate the assignment of leads. We want every sales rep to succeed, and want at least 40% of their pipeline to be from inbound sales. We needed to create a system that assigned leads fairly and accurately, and have a process that involved the sales rep as little as possible.\n\nMost importantly, we want a sales rep to have absolutely zero doubts when going after a new lead they receive. We want them to take ownership and not worry about stepping on toes. We believe the best way to do this is fully investigate each lead we receive and assign it to the correct person.\n\nTherefore, our lead assignment system is purely human.\n\nAs leads come in, our sales management team investigates each lead and decides if it needs to be sent to someone working on that school already or go into the rotation. While it may seem like a lot of work, it actually saves the sales reps the burden of doing the investigation themselves.\n\nThey are notified of new leads in Close.io via a task, with all of the contact information already populated for them. All of the sales campaign tracking is there too, so all they have to worry about is pitching and closing. Nothing else matters.\n\nThe lesson here is to try and avoid your sales team confronting each other about who owns what lead. Just handle it for them from the start.\n\nWhen conflicts pop up (and they will), just have them bring it up to the sales manager to handle it objectively together.  It protects each rep and will go a long way in terms of giving your team confidence when they call on a new lead.\n\n#### Part 3 - Outbound Sales & Marketing\n\nIn part three, I will go into how we've managed to scale and run a profitable outbound sales campaign that generates up to 60% of our total sales pipeline. Until then, happy selling!\n\n\n","html":"<p><i>\"Tools of the Trade\" is a series of posts that cover all of the services and processes we use on the sales team at Krossover.

They often fall into the crushing trap of treating their sales team as they would treat developers (or themselves). An inside sales team should operate as an entirely different company, bound by a different set of rules and expectations. The exception to this rule is culture.\n\nSince most startup founders have little experience with sales, they look for guidance in sales books and blog posts just like this. It’s common for books and posts to reference two very popular movies about sales that I’m sure you’ve seen or heard of: <i>Boiler Room</i> and <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>.\n\nThese movies portray sales as a toxic environment that’s aggressive and under extreme pressure. This attitude may have worked when these movies were made, but they don’t work today.\n\nTreating an inside sales team like they are treated in movies like <i>Boiler Room</i> or <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> is not going to fly. Just about the only part of those movies that I would take as constructive advice is hustle. However, hustle should not be confused with being an arrogant jackass to your prospects. Your salespeople are not selling to the buyer’s those movies represent. Today’s buyers are more knowledgeable, they have more access to information, and have more choices.\n\nYour team needs to know how to sell without applying direct force, and making the environment in which they sell should be the same way. Below are some tips on how to manage your sales team throughout the week to optimize for high productivity with a positive culture.\n\n### More Hours ≠ More Sales\n\nHolding your inside sales team to the same “hours worked” expectations as your product team will burn them out quick. They need to be on their game from the hours of 9AM-5PM selling your product. That’s it. Anything else will burn them out, and make them less effective when it counts.\n\nSalespeople shouldn’t be working 60+ hour weeks and staying in the office late. Our top sales reps spend the least time in the office because they make it happen between 9AM-5PM. Once the clock hits 9AM, they know that they only have 8 hours to squeeze as much opportunity from prospects as possible. If you take a look around, I’d be willing to bet that average to below-average revenue generating salespeople spend the most time in the office.\n\n### A Typical Sales Week\n\nYou can have a super productive sales team without constantly being on their back to perform. Use Monday to be stern in setting goals and share this week’s focus, and use Fridays to congratulate success. Limit any “all hands” meetings in the middle of the week as much as possible.\n\nAny quick chats you need to have with the sales team should be communicated individually or in very small groups for no longer than 10 minutes at a time. Try to disrupt the entire team as little as possible.\n\nHere’s the schedule of how a typical sales week goes for us at Krossover:\n\n* Monday: Morning standup for no longer than 15 minutes, share the goals for the week and general updates/announcements. Rest of the day is selling.\n* Tuesday: Selling, nothing scheduled.\n* Wednesday: Do something to break up the week See “Do Something on \nWednesday” below.\n* Thursday: Selling, nothing scheduled.\n* Friday: All sales stop at 4PM. Celebrate the week’s success\n\n### Do Something on Wednesday\n\nUse Wednesdays to break up the week. It’s hump day, so try picking one of the following “events” to give everyone a well-deserved change of pace:\n\n* “Work From Home Wednesday” — Where the entire sales team works from home on Wednesday. I looked at three weeks of sales activity data from our team (calls/opportunities/revenue) and saw no difference on Wednesday versus the other days of the week. I only recommend this for sales teams with less than five people.\n* “West Coast Wednesday” — My personal favorite. The entire sales team comes in two hours late in the morning and focuses on their opportunities on the West Coast. It usually just turns into a normal day, but some reps will stay an hour later to catch the mid-afternoon on the West Coast.\n* Everyone Leaves at 3PM — Pretty simple. Make everyone leave the office at 3PM on Wednesday afternoon. We all have errands to run!\n\n### Train Your Team To Sell Everything\n\nWhen I look at posts for sales jobs, I often see companies label them with some sort of specialized role. Titles like “Outbound Sales Specialist”, “Inbound Sales Specialist”, or some other specialized aspect of the sales process makes me scratch my head.\n\nYou should always train salespeople to sell your product in every way that its sold. Your salespeople should have the opportunity to sell any of your products in any way that it’s commonly sold.\n\nThat means that everyone’s pipeline should be a mixed bag of inbound, outbound, edge cases, or larger opportunities. This keeps things exciting, makes them better at all-around sales, and presents a daily challenge.\n\nNo one likes to be good at just one thing, help them become a master in all aspects of your sales process. It’s only going to help your team adapt to change as your company scales and new “specialized roles” become necessary.\n\n### HYWKA (“Hell Yeah, We Kick Ass!”)\n\nEvery sales team should have a Friday afternoon HYWKA (“Hell Yeah, We Kick Ass!”) standup to conclude the week. Every single week has a bright spot that should be congratulated.\n\nStop selling at 4PM, grab some beers from the fridge, and huddle around to share what kick ass things went on this week. Between each announcement there should be a thunderous round of applause and cheering. It sends everyone into the weekend on a positive note regardless of what happened that week, and keeps perspective of why you’re all there.\n\nHere is a sample outline of “HYWKA” each week:\n\n<i>Individual</i>\n\n* Welcome new hires, someone’s first closed deal, birthdays, etc.\n* Announce this week’s “Sales MVP” (revenue collected, booked, or some other key metric)\n* Look for someone who had their best week ever, share interesting metrics about it.\n* Share who is having success at the top of the funnel (new opportunities/pipeline), it shouldn’t always be about closed deals.\n* Give an update on who is leading the way for the month/quarter.\n\n<i>Entire Team</i>\n\n* “This week we closed X deals, and collected X revenue”, only if you hit your goals. If you didn’t hit goals, talk about the pipeline the team created that will lead you to crushing the goal next week.\n* Look for the metric where the team broke a weekly record, or did an outstanding job (number of demos, calls, new pipeline, avg. deal size).\n* Share new customer growth, in terms of week-over-week or month-over-month growth for give higher level context.\n* Look forward to next week, and end things with a positive outlook on the future.\n\nYour sales team’s jobs are stressful enough, why add to it with a stressful work environment? Unlike the movies, be better to your sales team and treat them with the respect they deserve. You’ll be rewarded with positive growth and a highly productive team!","html":"<p><i>Note: This was originally posted over at <a href=\"https://medium.com/sales-hacks/61d6de522f58\">Medium</a> under \"Sales Hacks\"</i></p>\n\n<p>Sales and product teams play two entirely different games and have no common definitions for success — why try to control and optimize them with the same set of rules?</p>\n\n<p>It’s no secret that startup founders aren’t usually salespeople.

Here's a picture of what that growth looks like:\n\n![alt](/content/images/2015/04/june2013-feb2014-growth.png)\n\nIn part three of my \"Tools of the Trade\" series, I'll cover how we handle outbound sales at <a href=\"http://www.krossover.com\">Krossover</a>. Outbound sales is the most difficult part of any company's sales process, and it requires a scientific approach to really do it right. The information below could help you establish benchmarks for evaluating success for an individual sales rep, the overall team, and determine the feasibility of continuing outbound sales. \n\n### Required Reading: Predictable Revenue\n\n<img src=\"http://predictablerevenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pr_logo.png\">\n\nMost of the writing about outbound sales for SaaS companies refer to a book by Aaron Ross called <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com-ebook/dp/B005ERYEGU/\">Predictable Revenue</i></a>. Aaron Ross was the man responsible for launching Salesforce's outbound sales department from nothing and turning it into over $100 million in recurring revenue for the company. I highly recommend this book, and it's a book we give every new sales rep that joins Krossover.\n\n### Outbound Lead Sources\n\nA good outbound sales process begins with your leads. Krossover is fortunate to have a straight forward prospect list. All we have to do is source the contact information for teams at every High School and College. The hard part for us is reaching those contacts and keeping the information current. More on that later.\n\nFor those of you that are looking to reach out to more complicated verticals such as specific people within a large organization, you need to try everything.\n\nExamples of \"trying everything\" could be:\n\n1. Buy a list from somewhere. (Check out <a href=\"http://www.data.com\">Data.com</a>)\n* Have your sales reps source leads themselves.\n* Have offshore resources (<a href=\"http://www.odesk.com\">oDesk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.taskus.com\">TaskUs</a>) source lead lists.\n* Build a lead list and have the company contact information for just the main phone line. Call asking for \"the person in charge of X\".\n\nOnce you establish a number of lead sources, it's important to evaluate how effective each source is. You should also look to take sourcing out the hands of your sales reps as soon as possible. We always try to avoid any sales reps sourcing or importing leads into the CRM. It takes away from their sales time, and it's a task that can be easily outsourced.\n\nWhen you import all of these leads in your CRM, be sure to tag the source of each lead. This will allow you to look back and figure out which lead sources performed the best.\n\n### Establish A Conversion Funnel\n\nIn outbound sales, the conversion funnel is an integral part to really understanding if your team can sustain an outbound sales campaign profitably.\n\n#### Costs To Think About\n\nWhen evaluting cost vs. revenue in outbound sales, look at your cost over the average sales cycle for your product. If you just look at your cost for the length of your sales cycle, you will be able to concentrate on looking at a sample size or \"batch\" of opportunities in your sales pipeline. It's easier to calculate.\n\nLet's say your average sales cycle is six weeks. Here's what you should be factoring into your costs:\n\n1. Outbound sales rep base salary for 6 weeks\n2. Lead sourcing cost for 6 weeks / number of leads = cost per lead\n3. Cost per lead X number of deals closed = Lead cost per deal\n\n#### Build A Sales Funnel, AKA \"The Billy\"\n\nI will demonstrate below how to build a conversion funnel over the course of a six week sales cycle, and figure out if outbound sales will be sustainable using something we call \"The Billy\" formula.\n\nLet's say Billy is your outbound sales rep, tasked with the job of creating a profitable outbound sales campaign in six weeks:\n\n1. Billy makes 1000 calls/emails.\n2. Billy confirms 100 of the leads he called. (10% reach rate**)\n3. Billy turns 50 of the confirmed leads into opportunities (50% opportunity rate**)\n4. Of those 50, Billy closes 10 of those opportunities (20% close rate**)\n\nWhat was the value on those 50 opportunities? Let's say $100/mo paid annually:\n\n\t- $1200/year x 50 opportunities = $60,000 pipeline value\n\t- Billy closed 10/50, equaling $12,000 in annual revenue\n\t- Billy got paid $4,038.46 in salary during the 6 weeks ($35k base)\n\t- Billy makes 20% commission = $12k x 20% = $2,400\n\nNow we need to figure out the total cost per deal:\n\n\t- Cost for Billy: $4,038.40/base + $2,400 comm. = $6,438.46\n\t- Billy closed 10 deals = $6,438.46 / 10 = $643.84\n\nOver six weeks of outbound sales, it cost you $643.84 for Billy to close each of his 10 deals. We also have to account for the 1000 leads that were sourced for Billy:\n\n\t- 1000 leads X $3 per lead = $3,000 total lead cost\n\t- $3,000 / 10 closed deals by Billy = $300 per closed deal\n\n<b>This brings our grand total to $943.84 ($643.84 + $300 per lead) to close a deal over the course of six weeks.</b>\n\nHere comes the fun part:\n\n* Total Revenue From Billy: $12,000\n* Total Sales Cost From Billy: $943.84 x ($300 x 10 deals) = $9,438.40\n* <b>$12,000 revenue - $9,438.40 cost = <font color=\"green\">$2,561.60 profit</u></b></font>\n\nIf Billy continues to have the same conversion rates every 6 weeks, you can predict that Billy will be a profitable outbound sales rep. Good job Billy!\n\n<img src=\"http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/excited-baby.gif\">\n\n<i>** A \"good\" conversion rate varies by product, sales cycle, and deal value. The above conversion rates are common for SaaS products with high volume and a deal value of $100/month recurring revenue. In outbound cold calling, a 10% reach rate is what you should aim for.</i>\n\n### What if Billy isn't profitable?\n\nIn the scenario where Billy is not profitable, which is often the case, the \"The Billy\" formula outlined a sales conversion funnel at each stage of a deal.\n\nYou should look at each stage or conversion metric, and start to play with the conversion rates - plugging in new numbers:\n\n* What if Billy increased his call volume by 20%?\n* What if you find a lead source that helped Billy confirm 10% more leads?\n* What if we could help Billy close one more deal out of his pipeline? (Discounts, training, etc)\n\nPlugging in these new conversion numbers will help your team figure out the point at which your outbound sales campaign becomes profitable. <b>The new conversion numbers should immediately become the goals Billy needs to hit each week.</b>\n\n### Focus On Your Weakest Conversion Rate\n\nFor our sales team, the most difficult part of our outbound sales funnel is our reach rate. Because we are calling high schools and colleges, we often find coaches are off campus or teaching a class.\n\nThis causes us to constantly ask ourselves: \"What can we do to increase our reach rate?\"\n\nOur team is very talented at making it happen once we get the opportunity to talk to a coach. We also have a badass product. We use our reach rate to be the deciding factor if we need to make a change with lead sources and/or try other strategies. We look at the reach rate over the course of 2-3 days, and make changes as needed.\n\n### Scaling Outbound Sales\n\nUsing \"The Billy\" example, we established that Billy would be a profitable outbound sales rep if he kept the above conversion rates intact.\n\nNow the question becomes: How do we add another Billy?\n\nAdding another Billy is a question of duplication. Can you easily duplicate everything it took for Billy to achieve those results? Can you get 1000 more leads that have the same results for a second sales rep? Is the vertical/market big enough for two reps to perform at the same level? Can you foot the bill while the new sales rep trains and gets to Billy's level of success?\n\nAll of these questions should help you answer how large you'll be able to scale your outbound sales team. An important thing to keep in mind is that you still have inbound to fall back on. If you are a small startup trying to make outbound sales happen, be sure to have a percentage of your sales reps' pipeline originate from inbound. That will keep them balanced in cost vs. profit.\n\nHaving a good inbound-to-outbound pipeline ratio will spread out the total cost of a sales rep, mix up the difficulty of selling your product (it should be easy sometimes), and hopefully help them make the money you promised them when they interviewed.\n\nNeed help building your own \"Billy\" formula?

I highly recommend this book, and it's a book we give every new sales rep that joins Krossover.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"outboundleadsources\">Outbound Lead Sources</h3>\n\n<p>A good outbound sales process begins with your leads. Krossover is fortunate to have a straight forward prospect list. All we have to do is source the contact information for teams at every High School and College. The hard part for us is reaching those contacts and keeping the information current. More on that later.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you that are looking to reach out to more complicated verticals such as specific people within a large organization, you need to try everything.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of \"trying everything\" could be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a list from somewhere. (Check out <a href=\"http://www.data.com\">Data.com</a>)  </li>\n<li>Have your sales reps source leads themselves.</li>\n<li>Have offshore resources (<a href=\"http://www.odesk.com\">oDesk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.taskus.com\">TaskUs</a>) source lead lists.</li>\n<li>Build a lead list and have the company contact information for just the main phone line. Call asking for \"the person in charge of X\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you establish a number of lead sources, it's important to evaluate how effective each source is. You should also look to take sourcing out the hands of your sales reps as soon as possible. We always try to avoid any sales reps sourcing or importing leads into the CRM. It takes away from their sales time, and it's a task that can be easily outsourced.</p>\n\n<p>When you import all of these leads in your CRM, be sure to tag the source of each lead. This will allow you to look back and figure out which lead sources performed the best.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"establishaconversionfunnel\">Establish A Conversion Funnel</h3>\n\n<p>In outbound sales, the conversion funnel is an integral part to really understanding if your team can sustain an outbound sales campaign profitably.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"coststothinkabout\">Costs To Think About</h4>\n\n<p>When evaluting cost vs. revenue in outbound sales, look at your cost over the average sales cycle for your product. If you just look at your cost for the length of your sales cycle, you will be able to concentrate on looking at a sample size or \"batch\" of opportunities in your sales pipeline. It's easier to calculate.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say your average sales cycle is six weeks. Here's what you should be factoring into your costs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Outbound sales rep base salary for 6 weeks  </li>\n<li>Lead sourcing cost for 6 weeks / number of leads = cost per lead  </li>\n<li>Cost per lead X number of deals closed = Lead cost per deal</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"buildasalesfunnelakathebilly\">Build A Sales Funnel, AKA \"The Billy\"</h4>\n\n<p>I will demonstrate below how to build a conversion funnel over the course of a six week sales cycle, and figure out if outbound sales will be sustainable using something we call \"The Billy\" formula.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say Billy is your outbound sales rep, tasked with the job of creating a profitable outbound sales campaign in six weeks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Billy makes 1000 calls/emails.  </li>\n<li>Billy confirms 100 of the leads he called. (10% reach rate**)  </li>\n<li>Billy turns 50 of the confirmed leads into opportunities (50% opportunity rate**)  </li>\n<li>Of those 50, Billy closes 10 of those opportunities (20% close rate**)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What was the value on those 50 opportunities? Let's say $100/mo paid annually:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- $1200/year x 50 opportunities = $60,000 pipeline value\n- Billy closed 10/50, equaling $12,000 in annual revenue\n- Billy got paid $4,038.46 in salary during the 6 weeks ($35k base)\n- Billy makes 20% commission = $12k x 20% = $2,400\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we need to figure out the total cost per deal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- Cost for Billy: $4,038.40/base + $2,400 comm. = $6,438.46\n- Billy closed 10 deals = $6,438.46 / 10 = $643.84\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Over six weeks of outbound sales, it cost you $643.84 for Billy to close each of his 10 deals. We also have to account for the 1000 leads that were sourced for Billy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- 1000 leads X $3 per lead = $3,000 total lead cost\n- $3,000 / 10 closed deals by Billy = $300 per closed deal\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>This brings our grand total to $943.84 ($643.84 + $300 per lead) to close a deal over the course of six weeks.</b></p>\n\n<p>Here comes the fun part:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Total Revenue From Billy: $12,000</li>\n<li>Total Sales Cost From Billy: $943.84 x ($300 x 10 deals) = $9,438.40</li>\n<li><b>$12,000 revenue - $9,438.40 cost = <font color=\"green\">$2,561.60 profit</u></b></font></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If Billy continues to have the same conversion rates every 6 weeks, you can predict that Billy will be a profitable outbound sales rep. Good job Billy!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/excited-baby.gif\"></p>\n\n<p><i>** A \"good\" conversion rate varies by product, sales cycle, and deal value. The above conversion rates are common for SaaS products with high volume and a deal value of $100/month recurring revenue. In outbound cold calling, a 10% reach rate is what you should aim for.</i></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatifbillyisntprofitable\">What if Billy isn't profitable?</h3>\n\n<p>In the scenario where Billy is not profitable, which is often the case, the \"The Billy\" formula outlined a sales conversion funnel at each stage of a deal.</p>\n\n<p>You should look at each stage or conversion metric, and start to play with the conversion rates - plugging in new numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What if Billy increased his call volume by 20%?</li>\n<li>What if you find a lead source that helped Billy confirm 10% more leads?</li>\n<li>What if we could help Billy close one more deal out of his pipeline? (Discounts, training, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plugging in these new conversion numbers will help your team figure out the point at which your outbound sales campaign becomes profitable. <b>The new conversion numbers should immediately become the goals Billy needs to hit each week.</b></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"focusonyourweakestconversionrate\">Focus On Your Weakest Conversion Rate</h3>\n\n<p>For our sales team, the most difficult part of our outbound sales funnel is our reach rate. Because we are calling high schools and colleges, we often find coaches are off campus or teaching a class.</p>\n\n<p>This causes us to constantly ask ourselves: \"What can we do to increase our reach rate?\"</p>\n\n<p>Our team is very talented at making it happen once we get the opportunity to talk to a coach. We also have a badass product. We use our reach rate to be the deciding factor if we need to make a change with lead sources and/or try other strategies. We look at the reach rate over the course of 2-3 days, and make changes as needed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scalingoutboundsales\">Scaling Outbound Sales</h3>\n\n<p>Using \"The Billy\" example, we established that Billy would be a profitable outbound sales rep if he kept the above conversion rates intact.</p>\n\n<p>Now the question becomes: How do we add another Billy?</p>\n\n<p>Adding another Billy is a question of duplication. Can you easily duplicate everything it took for Billy to achieve those results? Can you get 1000 more leads that have the same results for a second sales rep? Is the vertical/market big enough for two reps to perform at the same level? Can you foot the bill while the new sales rep trains and gets to Billy's level of success?</p>\n\n<p>All of these questions should help you answer how large you'll be able to scale your outbound sales team. An important thing to keep in mind is that you still have inbound to fall back on. If you are a small startup trying to make outbound sales happen, be sure to have a percentage of your sales reps' pipeline originate from inbound. That will keep them balanced in cost vs. profit.</p>\n\n<p>Having a good inbound-to-outbound pipeline ratio will spread out the total cost of a sales rep, mix up the difficulty of selling your product (it should be easy sometimes), and hopefully help them make the money you promised them when they interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Need help building your own \"Billy\" formula?

It's fine to give in to their process a bit, but you need to be in control in terms of the communication going forward.\n\nSimply put, the prospect needs to know that long email chains aren't going to fly.

It's your job to give the information to the prospect your way. You need to control how the information is consumed via a live demo or presentation. After the call, the information you send is a recap of what you talked about.\n\nIf they're determined to receive \"some information\", make sure you have them explain why by asking \"<i>what exact information will they be looking for</i>\", or \"<i>the best way to get all of the information you need is a quick 5-10 minute demo - are you in front of a computer?</i>\".\n\nThe information you are providing to a prospect always needs to be describing a benefit. Don't explain what the buttons do, tell them what will they'll receive when they hit the buttons.\n\n\n### Keep calling.\n\nWe've all had the no show. You had a great demo call with a prospect, you set a follow up for next week, and then they disappear. The best way to follow up is to call without leaving voicemails.

Mentors always say to write about the subjects that people ask you about the most. With this post, I'm taking their advice.\n\nHere are the common questions I get about sending cold emails:\n\n* What do I write?\n* How do I respond?\n* What's a good response rate?\n\nRegardless of what the product or service I'm selling, my cold emails always have the same structure. I never change. I never change because I'm always looking for the same result when I send a cold email, and that's to schedule a quick phone call.\n\n### Cold Email Structure\n\n```\nSubject: {Company Name} + {Your Company}\n\n1. Hi, my name is Nick with {Your Company}.\n2. We help {specific company type} with {one liner}.\n3. I wanted to learn how you handle {thing your company handles} at {Company Name} and show you what we're working on.\n4. Ask for a quick call tomorrow afternoon.\n```\nThe structure is very simple because I'm only looking for one thing to happen. That one thing is a quick call as soon as possible. Don't use the email to explain everything you do. All of that information should be on your website, which they almost always go check out before they decide to reply.\n\nAs an example, here is a cold email I would send if I trying to sell [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) to a law firm: \n\n```\nSubject: Larry's Law Firm + Dropbox\n\nHi Larry,\n\nMy name is Nick with Dropbox.\n\nWe help law firms store & manage all of their client data securely in the cloud. I wanted to learn how you handle data storage at Larry's Law Firm and show you what we're working on.\n\nAre you available for a quick call tomorrow afternoon?\n\nCheers,\n\nNick Persico\nAccount Manager, Dropbox.com\n555-555-5555\nfake.nick@dropbox.com\n```\n\nTo use a real world example, here is a [Smart Host](http://www.smarthost.me) cold email I used to get a 12% response rate just last week:\n\n```\nHi Mike,\n\nMy name is Nick and I’m a co-founder at Smart Host. We help property managers optimize their pricing on marketplaces like HomeAway, VRBO, and Flipkey.\n\nI wanted to learn how you currently handle price optimization and show you what we're working on.\n\nAre you available for a quick call tomorrow afternoon?\n\nCheers,\n\nNick Persico\nSmart Host\nnick@smarthost.me\n555-555-5555\nhttp://www.smarthost.me\n```\n\nThe point of writing the email this way is to quickly explain who, what, why, and when. If Larry or Mike is opening the email, they will go to the website and decide if they want to learn more. Their decision to reply has very little to do with what your email says. It's all about what your website says.\n\nThe email is also soft selling the prospect. The reason for this is because I'm not sure if Larry or Mike is even qualified to buy my product. I just want to learn about what he currently does, and if he is qualified I'll move forward and \"show him what we're working on\".\n\n### Handling The Responses\n\nThe responses from these type of cold emails will vary. You will get responses like a date and a time to call, some reason why they're not interested, or a bunch of questions. Regardless of the response, you're goal is to get a call scheduled.\n\nOne bad habit I see from a lot of sales reps is getting into back and forth emails with the prospect. As I wrote in [my last post](http://nickpersico.com/we-dont-sell-over-email/), you shouldn't be trying to sell over email. Selling over email puts you in the worst possible position to win because the prospect has time to think about reasons why they shouldn't buy what you are selling.\n\n#### Is their reply a question? Give them a call immediately.\n\nCall the prospect immediately if they reply to your cold email with a question. A question from a prospect is always an opportunity to engage with them. Don't leave a voicemail if they don't pick up. Instead, email them back saying you just tried to give them a call and ask for a better time to reach out.\n\nIf they do answer, here is a simple script for how I handle this type of call:\n\n```\nMe: \"Hi Mike, this is Nick from Smart Host.\"\n\nMike: \"Hey Nick.\" (probably confused)\n\nMe: \"Did I catch you at a bad time?\"\n\nMike: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\nMe: \"I just got your email about {the question he asked} and I figured it would be better to just give you a call to make sure there's no confusion.\"\n\nMe: {Answer the question directly}\n\nMe: {I then ask Mike the first qualifying question}\n\nMike: {Starts answering the question}\n```\n\nWith this strategy, you got what you wanted. A quick call to qualify the prospect and set up next steps in the sales process.\n\n### 10% Response Rate\n\nThe ideal response rate for all cold emails is 10%. Out of 100 emails you send, you should get a human response from 10 people. Not all of them will result in a call, but that's what you should expect. This does not include out of office notices or bounced emails.\n\nI don't have a scientific reason why the response rate should be 10%, but it has always been a good indicator of lead list quality. If you are getting lower than a 10% response rate, you should evaluate the lead list and look for other sources to compare them with.\n\nIn the exciting event where you've got a response rate over 10%, be wary of how many leads you qualify from those responses. Just because they are eager to talk does not make them qualified.\n\n### Put It To The Test\n\nAt the end of the day, the above tactics are my opinion. These type of cold emails have worked well for me. If you're not convinced, let's put it to the test.\n\nTry sending 100 cold emails using the above email structure and post the results below. Let's see how it stacks up to the current cold emails you send. Can your cold emails perform better?\n\nNeed help crafting cold emails for your startup? [Let's talk](https://clarity.fm/nickpersico) or [shoot me an email](mailto:nicklpersico@gmail.com).\n","html":"<p>The most common questions I get about sales usually center around sending cold emails. Mentors always say to write about the subjects that people ask you about the most. With this post, I'm taking their advice.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the common questions I get about sending cold emails:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What do I write?</li>\n<li>How do I respond?</li>\n<li>What's a good response rate?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regardless of what the product or service I'm selling, my cold emails always have the same structure. I never change. I never change because I'm always looking for the same result when I send a cold email, and that's to schedule a quick phone call.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"coldemailstructure\">Cold Email Structure</h3>\n\n<pre><code>Subject: {Company Name} + {Your Company}\n\n1. Hi, my name is Nick with {Your Company}.  \n2. We help {specific company type} with {one liner}.  \n3. I wanted to learn how you handle {thing your company handles} at {Company Name} and show you what we're working on.  \n4. Ask for a quick call tomorrow afternoon.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The structure is very simple because I'm only looking for one thing to happen. That one thing is a quick call as soon as possible. Don't use the email to explain everything you do. All of that information should be on your website, which they almost always go check out before they decide to reply.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, here is a cold email I would send if I trying to sell <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> to a law firm: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Subject: Larry's Law Firm + Dropbox\n\nHi Larry,\n\nMy name is Nick with Dropbox.\n\nWe help law firms store &amp; manage all of their client data securely in the cloud. I wanted to learn how you handle data storage at Larry's Law Firm and show you what we're working on.\n\nAre you available for a quick call tomorrow afternoon?\n\nCheers,\n\nNick Persico  \nAccount Manager, Dropbox.com  \n555-555-5555  \nfake.nick@dropbox.com  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To use a real world example, here is a <a href=\"http://www.smarthost.me\">Smart Host</a> cold email I used to get a 12% response rate just last week:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Hi Mike,\n\nMy name is Nick and I’m a co-founder at Smart Host. We help property managers optimize their pricing on marketplaces like HomeAway, VRBO, and Flipkey.\n\nI wanted to learn how you currently handle price optimization and show you what we're working on.\n\nAre you available for a quick call tomorrow afternoon?\n\nCheers,\n\nNick Persico  \nSmart Host  \nnick@smarthost.me  \n555-555-5555  \nhttp://www.smarthost.me  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The point of writing the email this way is to quickly explain who, what, why, and when. If Larry or Mike is opening the email, they will go to the website and decide if they want to learn more. Their decision to reply has very little to do with what your email says. It's all about what your website says.</p>\n\n<p>The email is also soft selling the prospect. The reason for this is because I'm not sure if Larry or Mike is even qualified to buy my product.

Therefore, your not selling just a product. You're selling a change in behavior. Your product is just a way to reduce the friction sorrounding the change.\n\nAsk yourself and the prospect: How will using this product change their day-to-day business?

Are they ready, willing, and excited to make the change?\n\n#### Do their work for them.\n\nAlways put your prospect in a position to experience your product with as little friction as possible.

If you offer a free trial or demo, onboard them like you would a paying customer.\n\nWhen two parties are working towards an agreement, they'll each go through due dilligence to evaluate the risks and benefits.\n\nAs a salesperson, you have to do that for both parties.\n\n#### You've earned the right to close once you're holding the deal up.\n\nBe the person holding the deal up if you're not confident that the customer will be successful using your product.

It isn't likely you will get very far on the first call, so you need to optimize for getting a second call. This isn't easy, because any cold call is naturally uncomfortable for both parties.\n\nAs a salesperson, it's your job to make both you and the prospect as comfortable as possible. Removing animosity and confusion will put you in a great position to get to the next step of your sales process.\n\n#### Did I catch you at a bad time?\n\nThe most powerful phrase I've learned in phone sales is \"did I catch you at a bad time?\". This phrase is used by many, as it's been referenced and taught in Aaron Ross' book <i>[Predictable Revenue](http://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213)</i>. I've referred to <i>Predictable Revenue</i> on numerous occasions, as I believe it's one of the most complete works on B2B SaaS sales ever written.\n\nI'm a passionate student of \"sales theory\", and I find myself dissecting this phrase every time I'm training new salespeople. The format of the question contains trigger words that seem to yield a desirable answer.\n\nLet the dissection begin:\n\n* <b>\"Did I catch you..\"</b> - Casual, confident, and slang-like terminology. It helps you seem calm and composed.\n* <b>\"..at a bad time?\"</b> - The word \"bad\" is negative. Any normal human will want to reject anything negative.\n\nThe optimal answer you want to this question is \"No\". It's my opinion that the trigger word \"bad\" is subconciously connected to the word \"no\":\n\n* bad = no\n* bad ≠ yes\n\nAbove all, it's a question that has the intent of being respectful. You're unexpectedly interupting someone's day, and you have no idea what you'll find on the other end of the line.\n\n#### How to use it.\n\nHere's an example script that I use at the beginning of every cold call. Let's assume the person you're trying to reach picks up the phone:\n\n```\nProspect: Hello?\nYou: Hi, my name is Nick and I'm calling with a company called Startup X. Did I catch you at a bad time?\nProspect: What's this about?\nYou: I'm with a company called Startup X. We help [type of company you called] with the [thing you help them with]. Did I catch you at a bad time?\nProspect: Uhh..some variation of [Yes] or [No]\n```\n\n#### You're happy with any answer.\n\nMy favorite thing about \"Did I catch you at a bad time?\" is that you can be happy with any answer. The desired outcome in any first call is earning the right to get the next call. While you've asked a question that should help build respect and rapport with your prospect, you're also putting yourself in a position to benefit regardless of what the answer is.\n\n<b>If the prospect says \"yes\":</b>\n\n* You now know that you need to cleanly wrap the call up.\n* Respond with asking for a good time to call back.\n* If there is push back on a next call, describe your intent and ask for their email.\n* Your highest priority is to get a next call.\n\n<b>If the prospect says \"no\":</b>\n\n* Great! Move forward with your script and thank them for their time.\n\nAll things considered, \"did I catch you at a bad time?\" helps the entire conversation get off to a good start. There's no need to hide the fact that you are calling someone out of the blue, so embrace it by asking for the right to continue the call. \n\nYour experience as a salesperson will be so much more pleasant.\n\n![alt](/content/images/2014/12/Photo-Sep-04--8-31-05-PM.jpg)\n\n\nHappy Selling!\n\n","html":"<p>The first ten seconds of a cold call determines how effective you'll be in your first interaction with a prospect.

There's no need to hide the fact that you are calling someone out of the blue, so embrace it by asking for the right to continue the call. </p>\n\n<p>Your experience as a salesperson will be so much more pleasant.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/12/Photo-Sep-04--8-31-05-PM.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>Happy Selling!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1418584862952,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1418665633196,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1418592256457,"published_by":1},{"id":25,"uuid":"eba469a6-13b5-4d54-b8a8-7e4617ab7567","title":"A Boynton Beach Sunrise","slug":"a-boynton-beach-sunrise","markdown":"My Dad and I went out to Boynton Beach at 6AM to see the [SpaceX CRS-5 launch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-5) out of Cape Canaveral.

If you're looking to grow your sales team, I highly recommend using CloserIQ to get great candidates in your pipeline.*\n\nIf you run an early-stage startup, your first sales hires—and how you train and introduce them to your company—will set the tone for the next stage of your startup’s growth. After all, it’s likely that this will be the first time your product will be sold by someone other than you or your cofounders. It’s the first time that people without the context of your company’s history will represent you.\n\nAnd these early team members are especially critical because they’ll become leaders for the next batch of salespeople that follow them; their habits, skills, and experience will rub off on new team members to come. So think of your first salespeople as founders of the sales team.\n\nAnd as a founder, it’s *your job* to put your new salespeople in a position to be successful. (After all, poor sales management leads to high sales churn.) They need to feel inspired and involved. Here’s what you can do to make that happen:\n\n#### 1. Always hire more than one salesperson at a time.\n\nAny time you’re hiring salespeople, hire more than one. In your company’s early days, you won’t have data to help measure a sale hire’s progress. You won’t know what, exactly, “good” or “bad” performance means. Hiring two or three people can help you figure this out, create competition among them, and also protect you if someone quits or needs to be let go.\n\nHiring a batch of salespeople will also benefit your new hires. Being the lone first salesperson at a new company is hard: there are no precedents in place, no examples of success. So make sure your first sales team is a pair or a group of peers who can experience the job together.\n\n#### 2. Schedule their first day for a Saturday.\n\nFirst impressions are everything. The chaos of a Monday morning should not be the way your new team members interact with you for the first time. (This works in your favor, too; you know that running a startup is a constant battle against time, so why waste a precious weekday on training?) Instead, plan to have your new sales team start on a Saturday when you can really focus on teaching them the basics and introducing them to the rest of the company.\n\nHere’s how a Saturday spent onboarding your new sales team might go:\n\n* 9:00 a.m.: Have breakfast, make introductions, and fill out legal paperwork.\n* 9:30 a.m.: Give a fun presentation on your company’s history and how you got to this point. Don’t forget to take questions!\n* 10:30 a.m.: Tell your new team about your industry. Who are they selling to? Who are the players? Why are we doing this?\n* 11:00 a.m.: Go over your email and phone scripts and what they’ll be expected to accomplish by the end of their first week.\n* 12:00 p.m.: Have lunch.\n* 1:00 p.m.: Train them on basic CRM and sales tools, like how to contact people and use lead lists.\n* 2:00 p.m.: Review the scripts and make mock calls so your team can start making calls and sending emails Monday morning.\n* 3:00 p.m.: Get drinks as a team, and invite investors and even customers, if possible.\nNow when your new sales team comes back in on Monday, they’ll already know what they have to do to be successful in their new jobs.\n\n#### 3. Don’t overload your new sales team with information.\n\nAll your new sales hires need to know at this point is how to be successful in their first week. If their first task is to schedule product demos by making cold calls and sending cold emails, train them only for that. This early on, there’s no need to show them every aspect of your sales process, how to send an invoice, or even how to conduct a demo (and even if you do teach this information right away, it likely won’t be retained).\n\nInstead, cross each bridge when your salespeople actually reach these points with real prospects. Practice scripts with them so they get better at scheduling demos; once they’ve nailed that, then they can conduct demos themselves. Essentially, learning the next step in the sales process should be a reward for mastering the previous one.\n\n(You can see this tactic at work in the movie Boiler Room. Each new hire is only allowed to cold call prospects. Once they qualify a prospect, they have to watch a senior salesperson take the deal from there. After they master that first step in the sales process, they earn the right to close their own deals.)\n\n#### 4. Document everything (and we mean everything).\nStarting as a salesperson at a new company is like drinking through a fire hose. Retaining the amount of information necessary to do the job is impossible. So help them out by carefully documenting every part of your sales process, including scripts, frequently asked questions, CRM processes and definitions, and even trivial things like proper email signature structure.\n\nGive your salespeople the ability to look up anything on their own. When they ask you a question, refer them to the materials. (It may seem mean-spirited, but it’s the best way to establish that they are expected to follow directions.) Plus, it’ll save you from having to answer the same questions over and over again.\n\nEncourage your sales team to contribute to the documentation too. As they learn new tips and tricks on how to sell your product, they should be sharing it with everyone.\n\nAs a real-life example, here’s what the sales onboarding documentation at my company, Smart Host, looks like:\n\n![alt](http://blog.closeriq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/smart_host-sales_onboarding-1024x590.png)\n\nYes, we’re thorough. Over-communication is key. If you want your sales team to operate with a certain level of professionalism, give them a step-by-step guide of how to operate at that level.\n\n#### 5. As the old adage goes, lead by example.\n\nOrganization and attention to detail will rub off on your team and create a culture of excellence. If you lead by example, and follow the above steps, your new sales team will practically onboard themselves.","html":"<p><img src=\"http://blog.closeriq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/boiler-room-training-new-sales-team.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>This post was originally posted on <a href=\"http://blog.closeriq.com/2015/02/training-new-sales-team-startup/\">CloserIQ's blog</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.closeriq.com\">CloserIQ</a> is a sales career platform connecting top sales talent to startups.

You're days away from being a part of an amazing and diverse group of people that have all experienced the ride. The circumstances, perspectives, and stories about \"the ride\" are different for everyone, which is what makes the experience so special.\n\nI participated in StartupBus North America 2014 on the New York City bus and helped build a company called [Smart Host](http://www.smarthost.me). The idea was to automate pricing for short-term rental hosts on Airbnb and HomeAway. Things went well for us, as we wound up [winning the competition](http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/2014/03/07/buspreneurs-on-2014-startupbus-experience/) and decided to [quit our jobs to build Smart Host full-time](http://skift.com/2014/08/29/travel-startup-smart-host-aims-to-bring-flexible-pricing-to-vacation-rentals/). But more importantly, it was the beginning of many of lifelong friendships that I'm lucky to have.\n\nThis post is an attempt to share my perspective of climbing aboard the StartupBus as a hustler. In my opinion, the \"hustler\" is the most misunderstood and under-appreciated role in comparison to \"hackers\" and \"hipsters\", or engineers and designers, respectively.\n\nTo help guide this year's StartupBus hustlers, below are some tips and tricks that can help put your team in a position to be successful.\n\n#### Pick the team, not the idea.\n\nThe trip begins with each person standing up in front of the bus to introduce themselves and pitch an idea. Since you're a hustler, the group will naturally have a higher expectation for how you conduct yourself.\n\nThe introductions and pitches are the only data points you have to make a decision about which team you're going to be on. I tried to market myself as outgoing, not afraid of public speaking, and someone who will get the job done.\n\nInstead of waiting for people to come up to me, I did what every hustler should do naturally. I went up to people I found smart and interesting to show interest in their idea.\n\nFor example, I wrote down the programming languages and frameworks each person mentioned when they were pitching. I heard a couple of folks mention Python, so I tried to convince each of them to work on the same team. I assumed that it would allow the team to get started quickly, and not have people trying to learn a new programming language in order to contribute.\n\nOverall, I optimized to find a team with skills that complimented each other. I honestly didn't care about the idea. The team mattered to me most.\n\n#### Like it or not, you are the team's caretaker.\n\nAs a hustler on StartupBus, you'll often find yourself doing things that have little to do with strategy or building the product. There are lots of little situations that will distract your team from getting things done.\n\nIt's your job to take over all of those distractions:\n\n * What's the team going to eat?\n * Do our conductors or the competition need something from us?\n * Is anyone on the team being blocked from doing their job?\n * Are our hotel rooms handled?\n * Does each person on the team know where they need to be at a certain time?\n\nBe the person that runs interference on any person or thing that will distract the team from focusing on advancing the business. Your team may not notice it at first, but they will thank you for it afterwards.\n\n#### Focus on the pitch even if you're not the one pitching.\n\nIt's common for StartupBus teams to have the hustler be the person that handles the pitch by default. Over the course of the trip, it felt like we were asked to pitch every fifteen minutes.\n\nIn our case, I would of been the one pitching Smart Host to hundreds of people if we hadn't made a crucial last minute decision to change presenters. In hindsight, the decision was a no-brainer.\n\nHere's the backstory:\n\nI spent the majority of the trip pitching, running interference, building the deck, and crafting the story we were going to tell on stage. We all just assumed that I was going to pitch because I was the hustler and spent the most time on it.\n\nWe started to realize that I was doing an awful job at pitching Smart Host. I wasn't confident. I was stumbling. I was exhausted. Things weren't looking good.\n\nOn the morning of Day 3, we were in the lobby of our hotel in Little Rock, Arksansas practicing the pitch. Our conductors were worried about how bad our pitch was, and suggested that we record it to get feedback.\n\nHere's one of the embarrassing recordings:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1TziOarsTU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPretty bad, right?\n\nSoon after that video was recorded, I knew that I either had to get better at pitching fast or give the job to someone else on our team. I felt terrible about it, and did not want to let the team down.\n\nTowards the end of the video, my face says it all:\n\n![alt](/content/images/2015/05/nick-hustle-lost.gif)\n\nA day passed, and my pitch did not get any better.\n\nAbout an hour before we were set to hit the stage in the first round, one of our conductors suggested that we change presenters. The team did not want to take it from me, but I knew it had to be done. So we decided to switch and have Evan do the pitch.\n\nIt was clearly the right decision. Evan made an impression in the first round and stole the show in the semifinals to get us into the final round.\n\nHere's Evan pitching in the finals:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVbAmJFcBNc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n#### Whatever it takes.\n\nA hustler does whatever it takes. It's really difficult for a hustler to \"show off\" their contributions to the team. You won't write much code. You probably won't make the logo. It may not even be your idea in the first place.\n\nYou need to be the invisible glue that holds everything together. Your contribution to the team is the final presentation that hits the stage on competition day.\n\n#### The real prize is personal growth.\n\nThe beauty of StartupBus is that you'll learn a lot about yourself. You will accomplish things in 72-hours that you never thought were possible. Things will break. Tensions will rise.

You're days away from being a part of an amazing and diverse group of people that have all experienced the ride. The circumstances, perspectives, and stories about \"the ride\" are different for everyone, which is what makes the experience so special.</p>\n\n<p>I participated in StartupBus North America 2014 on the New York City bus and helped build a company called <a href=\"http://www.smarthost.me\">Smart Host</a>. The idea was to automate pricing for short-term rental hosts on Airbnb and HomeAway. Things went well for us, as we wound up <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/2014/03/07/buspreneurs-on-2014-startupbus-experience/\">winning the competition</a> and decided to <a href=\"http://skift.com/2014/08/29/travel-startup-smart-host-aims-to-bring-flexible-pricing-to-vacation-rentals/\">quit our jobs to build Smart Host full-time</a>. But more importantly, it was the beginning of many of lifelong friendships that I'm lucky to have.</p>\n\n<p>This post is an attempt to share my perspective of climbing aboard the StartupBus as a hustler. In my opinion, the \"hustler\" is the most misunderstood and under-appreciated role in comparison to \"hackers\" and \"hipsters\", or engineers and designers, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>To help guide this year's StartupBus hustlers, below are some tips and tricks that can help put your team in a position to be successful.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"picktheteamnottheidea\">Pick the team, not the idea.</h4>\n\n<p>The trip begins with each person standing up in front of the bus to introduce themselves and pitch an idea. Since you're a hustler, the group will naturally have a higher expectation for how you conduct yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The introductions and pitches are the only data points you have to make a decision about which team you're going to be on. I tried to market myself as outgoing, not afraid of public speaking, and someone who will get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of waiting for people to come up to me, I did what every hustler should do naturally. I went up to people I found smart and interesting to show interest in their idea.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I wrote down the programming languages and frameworks each person mentioned when they were pitching. I heard a couple of folks mention Python, so I tried to convince each of them to work on the same team. I assumed that it would allow the team to get started quickly, and not have people trying to learn a new programming language in order to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I optimized to find a team with skills that complimented each other. I honestly didn't care about the idea. The team mattered to me most.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"likeitornotyouaretheteamscaretaker\">Like it or not, you are the team's caretaker.</h4>\n\n<p>As a hustler on StartupBus, you'll often find yourself doing things that have little to do with strategy or building the product. There are lots of little situations that will distract your team from getting things done.</p>\n\n<p>It's your job to take over all of those distractions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What's the team going to eat?</li>\n<li>Do our conductors or the competition need something from us?</li>\n<li>Is anyone on the team being blocked from doing their job?</li>\n<li>Are our hotel rooms handled?</li>\n<li>Does each person on the team know where they need to be at a certain time?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be the person that runs interference on any person or thing that will distract the team from focusing on advancing the business. Your team may not notice it at first, but they will thank you for it afterwards.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"focusonthepitchevenifyourenottheonepitching\">Focus on the pitch even if you're not the one pitching.</h4>\n\n<p>It's common for StartupBus teams to have the hustler be the person that handles the pitch by default. Over the course of the trip, it felt like we were asked to pitch every fifteen minutes.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, I would of been the one pitching Smart Host to hundreds of people if we hadn't made a crucial last minute decision to change presenters. In hindsight, the decision was a no-brainer.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the backstory:</p>\n\n<p>I spent the majority of the trip pitching, running interference, building the deck, and crafting the story we were going to tell on stage. We all just assumed that I was going to pitch because I was the hustler and spent the most time on it.</p>\n\n<p>We started to realize that I was doing an awful job at pitching Smart Host. I wasn't confident. I was stumbling. I was exhausted. Things weren't looking good.</p>\n\n<p>On the morning of Day 3, we were in the lobby of our hotel in Little Rock, Arksansas practicing the pitch. Our conductors were worried about how bad our pitch was, and suggested that we record it to get feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Here's one of the embarrassing recordings:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1TziOarsTU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>Pretty bad, right?</p>\n\n<p>Soon after that video was recorded, I knew that I either had to get better at pitching fast or give the job to someone else on our team. I felt terrible about it, and did not want to let the team down.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of the video, my face says it all:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/05/nick-hustle-lost.gif\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>A day passed, and my pitch did not get any better.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour before we were set to hit the stage in the first round, one of our conductors suggested that we change presenters. The team did not want to take it from me, but I knew it had to be done. So we decided to switch and have Evan do the pitch.</p>\n\n<p>It was clearly the right decision. Evan made an impression in the first round and stole the show in the semifinals to get us into the final round.</p>\n\n<p>Here's Evan pitching in the finals:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVbAmJFcBNc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h4 id=\"whateverittakes\">Whatever it takes.</h4>\n\n<p>A hustler does whatever it takes. It's really difficult for a hustler to \"show off\" their contributions to the team. You won't write much code. You probably won't make the logo. It may not even be your idea in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>You need to be the invisible glue that holds everything together. Your contribution to the team is the final presentation that hits the stage on competition day.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"therealprizeispersonalgrowth\">The real prize is personal growth.</h4>\n\n<p>The beauty of StartupBus is that you'll learn a lot about yourself.

Your Close.io Inbox is littered with outdated tasks and opportunities, which causes you to go on a wild safari throughout Close.io hunting for a golden set of leads that everyone forgot.\n\nYou push through the noise and you either hit or miss your goal. Then once the month or quarter is over, you reset and set new goals. But just a few weeks later, you’re in the same spot.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Close.io is built for sales productivity, but it takes healthy discipline to really get to the next level. While this is true with sales in general, there are a number of practical steps you can take to make all of your sales outcomes predictable and easy to track.\n\nAfter using Close.io everyday for almost 4 years, here are some pro tips on how to get organized, save time, and dramatically increase your outreach.\n\n## Create a repeatable process for yourself\n\nAs inside salespeople, a large part of our time is spent scheduling or conducting phone calls. We’re spending hours every week trying to fill up our schedule with meetings or demos at times that work for the prospect.\n\nIn order to enhance your sales outreach, you have to make time for it.\n\nCreate weekly recurring tasks in your calendar to block out time for specific sales tasks you conduct in Close.io. Block out time for things like \"Inbox Follow Up”, “New Outreach” or \"Opportunity Pipeline Cleanup”, which will allow you to direct scheduled calls with prospects around those times.\n\nIt’s not easy. You have to be disciplined. You have to constantly remind yourself not to schedule calls during those times. If you allocate and commit specific times on your calendar each week to perform specific sales tasks in Close.io, you’ll find that the amount of people you can reach becomes easy to predict.\n\nAs an example, here’s what my calendar looks like before I started adding scheduled calls to it:\n\n![alt](/content/images/2016/04/sales-calendar.png)\n\nA hidden benefit to blocking out time on your calendar for specific tasks is that it helps you track where your time is going. If things aren’t going well for you or the sales team at large, it often has to do with how your energy is being allocated. Teams will often ask themselves \"Are you reaching out to enough people?”, \"Are our leads good enough?”, and \"Can we even answer these questions?”\n\nHaving a record of where you spent your time in a given week can be a big help to solving the problem.\n\n## Use multiple Smart Views for new outreach\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see SDRs and AEs make in Close.io are their lead lists. They’ll often call or email out of a lead list (or “Smart View”) that has hundreds or thousands of leads. Try to avoid this at all costs.\n\nA huge list of leads may sound sexy, but it’s a total pain in the ass to deal with. You’ll often find multiple members of your team calling out of them at the same time, and it’s really hard to find your place when you want to call the next lead.\n\nWhen creating any Smart Views for outreach, follow these 4 rules\n\n1. A Smart View must always contain an aspect of time since the lead was last updated/contacted.\n\t1.Ex: Remove leads you’ve already updated today: *NOT updated:today*\n\t2. Ex: Include leads you have not called in the last 7 days: *latest_call_created > \"7 days ago\"*\n    \n2. A Smart View must always specify a lead status or statuses.\n\t1. Ex: You want to call only “Potential” leads: *lead_status:”Potential\"*\n\t2. Ex: You want to call any leads that are not bad fits: *NOT lead_status:”Bad Fit\"*\n\t3. Ex: You want to call both “Confirmed” and “Qualified” leads: *lead_status:”Confirmed” OR lead_status:”Qualified\"*\n\n3. When applicable, a Smart View should use Custom Fields to segregate leads into groups.\n\t1. Ex: You want to call leads that use “Salesforce”: *custom.CRM:Salesforce*\n\n4. When applicable, a Smart View should never include leads with incomplete tasks.\n\t1. Ex: NOT has:incomplete_tasks\n\nThese rules are designed to create Smart Views that remove leads as you work through them. **If you are using a Smart View as a lead list, you should set it up with an amount of leads that you can knock out in a single sitting.** That makes the task at hand very clear. Once there are no more leads, the task is complete!\n\nThe most common way to remove leads from your Smart Views as you go through them is add *NOT updated:today* to the end of your Smart View query.\n\n## Inbox zero for salespeople\n\nClose.io’s Inbox does a fantastic job in taking various sales activities and putting them into a single list of tasks. Incoming calls, voicemails, emails, tasks, and opportunities are all placed in a single view.\n\nBut it’s your job to consistently knock out those items so Inbox can actually accelerate your sales productivity. Close.io’s Inbox rewards users who are followers of the “Inbox Zero” approach to email and task management.\n\nIn order to get the most of out of Inbox in Close.io, here are some simple rules to follow:\n\n* Take care of your Close.io Inbox before your email inbox.\n\t* When you mark an incoming email as \"done\" in Close.io, it gets archived in your email inbox. However, when you archive or delete an email in your email inbox the task remains in Close.io. To only process the email once, start in Inbox.\n\t* Following this rule leaves your email inbox free of any sales email.\n* Do not create a task to follow up with an active opportunity.\n\t* Inbox creates tasks for any active opportunities by their close date. When you are updating your active opportunities, use the opportunity close date as the date when you’ll follow up next:\n\n![alt](/content/images/2016/04/sales-opportunity-follow-up.png)\n\n* Send emails from Close.io and utilize the email follow up feature in the event that you don’t get a response.\n\t* Close.io will automatically add these follow ups to your Inbox.\n\t* This replaces the need to create a separate follow up task.\n* Never create a task to follow up with a lead unless absolutely necessary.\n\t* A lead without an active or won opportunity should be funneling into a Smart View that has leads of a certain type that you need to follow up.\n\t* Use a time-based search query to dynamically send leads into a “Follow Up” Smart View: *last_communication_date > \"7 days ago\".*\n\t* If querying these leads are too difficult through lead status or custom fields, add a unique note to the lead so you can find them. For example:\n\t\t* You want to follow up with a confirmed lead in 14 days. There is no active opportunity. The lead is a part of a specific campaign called “annual conference”. There’s no way to isolate the lead via a custom field or lead status. There may be a handful of these leads.\n\t\t* Create a new note called “annual_conference” on the lead.\n\t\t* Create a Smart View that searches for all leads with the note “annual_conference” that don’t currently have an active opportunity: *note:\"annual_conference\" last_communication_date > \"14 days ago\" AND active_opportunities:0*\n\nThe last rule “Never create a task to follow up with a lead unless absolutely necessary” is especially important to increasing your sales productivity.\n\nUsing the example above, let’s say you create the note “annual_conference” on 25 leads. If you used a task to remind yourself to follow up with those 25 leads, you’d have 25 separate tasks in your Close.io Inbox 14 days later. Those 25 leads are then mixed with other Inbox items that have a different context.\n\nInstead, this method promotes a Smart VIew that holds all 25 of the leads you want to follow up. Then all you have to do is remind yourself on your calendar to go through the leads. Even better, you can [send a bulk email to all of the leads in the Smart View](https://help.close.io/customer/portal/articles/1383885-bulk-email) with just a few clicks.\n\n## How to have the best pipeline on your team\n\n*Note: The word “pipeline” refers to the Opportunities view in Close.io.*\n\nSalespeople are unique in how they are expected to communicate how bad or good they’re performing. There’s the obvious, like closed deals or new opportunities, but more sophisticated (and smart) sales teams want to know how effective you are.\n\n**One of the best ways to demonstrate your competency as a salesperson is the accuracy of your pipeline.** Since people use different criteria to define a “pipeline”, let’s assume that pipeline refers to a list of active opportunities.\n\nYou’ll find that having rigorous criteria for managing opportunities will give you the ability to predict the amount of deals you’ll close with extreme accuracy.\n\nHere’s what I mean by “rigorous criteria”:\n\n* You only have opportunities in your pipeline where the prospect knows how much they are going to pay for your product or service and it’s clear they can afford it.\n* You only have opportunities in your pipeline where you and the prospect discussed expectations around a timeline of when the deal with get done.\n* You only have opportunities in your pipeline that have communicated how they will use or get value out your product and you agree with them.\n\n**It’s not the size of your pipeline. It’s your pipeline conversion rate that really matters.**\n\nIf you don’t have enough opportunities that are required, that means you need to focus on qualifying the leads you’re reaching out to.\n\nNow for some practical tips on how to manage your pipeline in Close.io on a regular basis:\n\n* Set aside time every week to update every opportunity in your pipeline.\n\t* I recommend Fridays so you are prepared for the following week.\n* Remove any opportunities where you are guessing the “estimated close” date. Remember, an estimated close date can also mean the next day you are going to follow up.\n\t* Put these opportunities into a separate opportunity status so you can follow up later to get them active again.\n* If you find yourself regularly updating the estimated close date to the following week, is it even an opportunity?\n* Put context around the next step in the sales process in the opportunity note.\n\t* This helps you and your sales manager see the opportunity and the next step in one place in the “Opportunities” view.\n\n## Speaking about Close.io with management\n\nAt the beginning of this post, I suggested that the way management decides on a CRM or sales process is sometimes not in your best interest.\n\nIt’s not their fault. As humans, it’s in our nature to make decisions that benefit ourselves. That’s the way the world works.\n\nHowever, it’s on you to make the CRM and sales processes head in a direction that results in the highest level of productivity and success. It’s too easy to just sit around and blame “the process” as the reason why you don’t close deals.\n\nGet off your ass and make things better.\n\nTo create more influence when suggesting new processes or policies, here are some tips on how to interact with management in and around Close.io that will earn you respect:\n\n* When trying to communicate to management that your leads suck, don’t send a list of lead names. Send them a Smart VIew.\n\t* Use Custom Fields and communication activity to demonstrate why the leads aren’t good. A good example is building a Smart View with leads your team has contacted a certain number of times without converting.\n\t* Example: Leads that are still “Potential” that we’ve contacted at least 10 times in the past 3 months: *times_communicated > 10 last_communication_date < \"90 days ago\" status:Potential*\n* When management asks you to give them a report on your performance, tell them where to find it in Close.io:\n\t* Are they asking to see how your email conversion rates are going? Tell them to check your Sent Email Report.\n\t* Are they asking you to list which deals are going to close this month? Tell them to check your Opportunities pipeline or give them a Smart View.\n\t\t* Example Smart View: *opportunity_user:\"Nick Persico\" opportunity_close:\"this month\" opportunity_status:\"Active\"*\n* If management disagrees with your team on specific sales objections, track it in Close.io via a Custom Field or notes.\n\t* It’s best to use Custom Fields for this, but you may not be an admin in your Close.io organization. So create notes instead.\n\t* For example, if your team is losing deals because of a competitor, create a unique note like: “reason for loss: competitor_name”. Create a Smart View to send over.\n\nThe point of these tips are to create the expectation that management can always find the answers they’re looking for in your sales activity.\n\nWhen they are trying to tell their boss how many deals the team is going to close, they should be able to find it without you. If that happens, you’ll notice a much more pleasant experience at work.\n\n**However, it only works if you keep your Inbox at zero, your opportunity pipeline updated, and have badass Smart Views.**\n\nGet to work and make it happen!","html":"<p><em>This post was originally posted over at the <a href=\"http://blog.close.io/close.io-pro-tips-for-sdrs-and-aes\">Close.io blog.</a></em></p>\n\n<p>We’ve all been there: It’s the end of the month or quarter, and the pressure is on to create more opportunities and close more deals.</p>\n\n<p>But you can’t seem to find a good list of leads or opportunities to follow up on.

Those 25 leads are then mixed with other Inbox items that have a different context.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, this method promotes a Smart VIew that holds all 25 of the leads you want to follow up. Then all you have to do is remind yourself on your calendar to go through the leads. Even better, you can <a href=\"https://help.close.io/customer/portal/articles/1383885-bulk-email\">send a bulk email to all of the leads in the Smart View</a> with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"howtohavethebestpipelineonyourteam\">How to have the best pipeline on your team</h2>\n\n<p><em>Note: The word “pipeline” refers to the Opportunities view in Close.io.</em></p>\n\n<p>Salespeople are unique in how they are expected to communicate how bad or good they’re performing. There’s the obvious, like closed deals or new opportunities, but more sophisticated (and smart) sales teams want to know how effective you are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One of the best ways to demonstrate your competency as a salesperson is the accuracy of your pipeline.</strong> Since people use different criteria to define a “pipeline”, let’s assume that pipeline refers to a list of active opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll find that having rigorous criteria for managing opportunities will give you the ability to predict the amount of deals you’ll close with extreme accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what I mean by “rigorous criteria”:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You only have opportunities in your pipeline where the prospect knows how much they are going to pay for your product or service and it’s clear they can afford it.</li>\n<li>You only have opportunities in your pipeline where you and the prospect discussed expectations around a timeline of when the deal with get done.</li>\n<li>You only have opportunities in your pipeline that have communicated how they will use or get value out your product and you agree with them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>It’s not the size of your pipeline. It’s your pipeline conversion rate that really matters.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have enough opportunities that are required, that means you need to focus on qualifying the leads you’re reaching out to.</p>\n\n<p>Now for some practical tips on how to manage your pipeline in Close.io on a regular basis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set aside time every week to update every opportunity in your pipeline.\n<ul><li>I recommend Fridays so you are prepared for the following week.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Remove any opportunities where you are guessing the “estimated close” date. Remember, an estimated close date can also mean the next day you are going to follow up.\n<ul><li>Put these opportunities into a separate opportunity status so you can follow up later to get them active again.</li></ul></li>\n<li>If you find yourself regularly updating the estimated close date to the following week, is it even an opportunity?</li>\n<li>Put context around the next step in the sales process in the opportunity note.\n<ul><li>This helps you and your sales manager see the opportunity and the next step in one place in the “Opportunities” view.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"speakingaboutcloseiowithmanagement\">Speaking about Close.io with management</h2>\n\n<p>At the beginning of this post, I suggested that the way management decides on a CRM or sales process is sometimes not in your best interest.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not their fault. As humans, it’s in our nature to make decisions that benefit ourselves. That’s the way the world works.</p>\n\n<p>However, it’s on you to make the CRM and sales processes head in a direction that results in the highest level of productivity and success. It’s too easy to just sit around and blame “the process” as the reason why you don’t close deals.</p>\n\n<p>Get off your ass and make things better.</p>\n\n<p>To create more influence when suggesting new processes or policies, here are some tips on how to interact with management in and around Close.io that will earn you respect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When trying to communicate to management that your leads suck, don’t send a list of lead names. Send them a Smart VIew.\n<ul><li>Use Custom Fields and communication activity to demonstrate why the leads aren’t good. A good example is building a Smart View with leads your team has contacted a certain number of times without converting.</li>\n<li>Example: Leads that are still “Potential” that we’ve contacted at least 10 times in the past 3 months: <em>times<em>communicated > 10 last</em>communication_date &lt; \"90 days ago\" status:Potential</em></li></ul></li>\n<li>When management asks you to give them a report on your performance, tell them where to find it in Close.io:\n<ul><li>Are they asking to see how your email conversion rates are going? Tell them to check your Sent Email Report.</li>\n<li>Are they asking you to list which deals are going to close this month? Tell them to check your Opportunities pipeline or give them a Smart View.\n<ul><li>Example Smart View: <em>opportunity<em>user:\"Nick Persico\" opportunity</em>close:\"this month\" opportunity_status:\"Active\"</em></li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>If management disagrees with your team on specific sales objections, track it in Close.io via a Custom Field or notes.\n<ul><li>It’s best to use Custom Fields for this, but you may not be an admin in your Close.io organization. So create notes instead.</li>\n<li>For example, if your team is losing deals because of a competitor, create a unique note like: “reason for loss: competitor_name”. Create a Smart View to send over.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The point of these tips are to create the expectation that management can always find the answers they’re looking for in your sales activity.</p>\n\n<p>When they are trying to tell their boss how many deals the team is going to close, they should be able to find it without you. If that happens, you’ll notice a much more pleasant experience at work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, it only works if you keep your Inbox at zero, your opportunity pipeline updated, and have badass Smart Views.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Get to work and make it happen!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"After using Close.io everyday for almost 4 years, here are some pro tips on how to get organized, save time, and dramatically increase your outreach.","author_id":1,"created_at":1461632378056,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1461633270341,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1457456400000,"published_by":1}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"4d16b060-73f9-4e2b-b6fb-03bc6074edb7","name":"Nick Persico","slug":"nick-persico","password":"$2a$10$zvlTyEVq89pPTUZjaCNJY.26MEItYGu4cHNZGWtCdS9wf4tSp4U8C","email":"nicklpersico@gmail.com","image":"/content/images/2014/Jul/nick.png","cover":null,"bio":"Co-Founder of Smart Host.
